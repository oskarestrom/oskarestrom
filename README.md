### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there 

I am a problem-solver with a strong background in data analysis, data visualization, and image analysis using Python. I have a Master's in nanotechnology and a PhD in Engineering Physics. I have gradually fallen in love with coding and data and found that my passion lies in translating data into actionable insights to solve real-world challenges.
